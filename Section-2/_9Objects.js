//with objects we are able to assign a name to each of the values which was impossible with arrays, so we are grouping variables, which are really belongs together
//the objects has properties (like firstName...), many ways to creating objects, to create with {} like above: we are calling it: the object literal syntax
//big difference between objects and arrays is that by objects the order of their values does not matter at all when we want to retrive them
//we should use arrays for more ordered data and objects for more unstructere data and data that we want to name and then retrive from the object based on that name

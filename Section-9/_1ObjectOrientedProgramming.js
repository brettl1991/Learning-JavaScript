'use strict';
//a programming paradigm (style of the code) based on the concept of objects
//we pack data and the corresponding behavior into one block
//4 fundamental principles of OOP:
//1. Abstraction: ignore, hide details that dont matter, allowing us to get an overview of the thing we are implementing
//2. Encapsulation: keeping properties and methods private inside the class, so they are not accessible from outside the class. Bu some methods can be exposed as a public interface (API)
//3. Inheritance: making all properties and methods of a certain class available to a child class, this allow us to reuse common logic.
//4. Polymorphism: a child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class.
